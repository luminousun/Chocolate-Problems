# Chocolate-Problems
A data analysis project from Quera "Data Analysis with Python" course.

Vida loves chocolate and after seeing the advertisement of foreign chocolates, she couldn't stop herself and ordered a large shipment of chocolates! When the shipment arrived, Vida was faced with a mountain of great chocolates that she did not know the difference between. Fortunately, the seller of these chocolates sent Vida a list of the complete specifications of each chocolate, but since Vida does not understand much from this list, she asks you to help her find her favorite chocolates as soon as possible.
